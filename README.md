photon-tracer

photon-tracer does exactly what it says on the tin - it renders a scene using the photon tracing method.

#A Note on Quality

The general code qualty in this repositry is poor, at best. It was written largely in a caffiene fuled haze in the months leading up to the conclusion of a degree course. Between the other stresses that brings, and getting some actual sleep now and again, quality took somewhat of a back seat. Still, if you can get it working, please enjoy.

#Building

Building is going to be difficult, and not for the feint of heart. A lot of paths, particularly to OptiX libraries, are hardcoded. Some minor editing of the makefile or even the source may be nessicary to make it compile and run correctly.
